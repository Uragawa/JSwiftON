# JSwiftON

[![CI Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/Alex/JSwiftON.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/Alex/JSwiftON)

JSwiftON is a very simple convenience library to use JSON from Swift code.
It allows the sort of subscript chaining we used to have in Objective-C
while still enforcing optional unwrapping for primitive types and supports
Python-style negative subscripts for arrays.

## Example [Outdated]

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the
Example directory first.

Note that the example project is based on a public API that is no longer available. This will
be fixed in a future release.
